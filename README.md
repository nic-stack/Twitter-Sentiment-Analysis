# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
Description
This Python-based NLP project classifies airline tweets as positive, neutral, or negative with ~75% accuracy using Logistic Regression. It features text preprocessing with NLTK (tokenization, lemmatization, TF-IDF) and visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn to highlight sentiment trends. Built to analyze user feedback, it has applications in UX analytics and social impact, reflecting my passion for data-driven solutions inspired by entrepreneurial experiences.
Features

Dataset: Twitter Airline Sentiment dataset (~14,000 tweets from Kaggle).
Preprocessing: Tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization, and TF-IDF vectorization.
Model: Logistic Regression with scikit-learn.
Visualizations: Sentiment distribution and confusion matrix.

Requirements

Python 3.8+
Libraries: pandas, numpy, nltk, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
Install: pip install -r requirements.txt

Files

sentiment_analysis.py: Main script for data processing, modeling, and visualization.
sentiment_distribution.png: Bar plot of sentiment distribution.
confusion_matrix.png: Confusion matrix of model performance.
(Optional) sentiment_analysis.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook version.
(Dataset not included; download from Kaggle).

Usage

Clone the repository:git clone (https://github.com/nic-stack/Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis)


Install dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt


Download Tweets.csv from Kaggle and place in the project folder.
Run the script:python sentiment_analysis.py

Or open sentiment_analysis.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.

Results

Accuracy: ~80% on test data.
Visualizations: Bar plot and confusion matrix show sentiment trends and model performance.
Sample Prediction: "I love this airline!" â†’ Positive.

Future Improvements

Explore advanced models like BERT or LSTM.
Add real-time Twitter API integration.
Create Tableau dashboards for interactive visualizations ([Tableau Public link, if applicable]).
